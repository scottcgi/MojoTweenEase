## MojoTweenEase v1.0

MojoTweenEase is a collection of standard and custom tween ease functions. The implementation uses formula expansion for optimization.

The current implementations:

* For C#
* For C
* For JS

Support standard easing functions:

```
linear
quadraticIn,   quadraticOut,   quadraticInOut
cubicIn,       cubicOut,       cubicInOut
quarticIn,     quarticOut,     quarticInOut
quinticIn,     quinticOut,     quinticInOut
exponentialIn, exponentialOut, exponentialInOut
sineIn,        sineOut,        sineInOut
circularIn,    circularOut,    circularInOut
elasticIn,     elasticOut,     elasticInOut
backIn,        backOut,        backInOut
bounceIn,      bounceOut,      bounceInOut
```

Support custom easing functions:

```
backInExponentialOut, backInElasticOut
```
